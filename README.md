# PSPi Version 4 Software

https://discord.gg/aR5jzUY Version 4 discussion on Discord

**Project Features:**

ATmega (aka Arduino) NOT used for buttons and joystick, meaning the USB is left available

ADS1015 for joystick and battery detection (needs tweaking for V4 and 5.2v operation)

MCP23017 for buttons (Works Great)

4.3" LCD, driven by GPIO using custom overlay

**Goals:**

Integrate everything for buttons, joystick, and dimming into a single file

Have a battery meter in EmulationStation (maybe even within games?)

Improve audio quality (currently uses an audio circuit similar to Pi 2)
