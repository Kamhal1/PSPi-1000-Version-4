# PSPi Version 4 Software

ADS1015 for joystick and battery detection (needs tweaking for V4 and 5.2v operation)

MCP23017 for buttons (Works Great)

4.3" LCD, driven by GPIO using custom overlay

Audio circuit similar to Pi 2

Hoping to integrate everything for buttons, joystick, and dimming into a single file
