ADS1015 for joystick and battery detection (needs tweaking for V4 and 5.2v operation)

MCP23017 for buttons (Works Great)

Goals:

Integrate everything for buttons, joystick, and dimming into a single file

Have a battery meter in EmulationStation

Improve audio quality (currently uses an audio circuit similar to Pi 2)
